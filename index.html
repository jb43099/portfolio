        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I am a passionate and skilled web developer with a strong foundation in coding languages like HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. I graduated from Lake Forest College with a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Digital/Web
            Design.
            <br>
            In addition to my passion for web development, I'm dedicated to fitness and constantly seek ways to
            challenge and improve myself both mentally and physically. Alongside my gym commitment, I'm also an art
            enthusiast who appreciates various forms, including music, film, fashion, fragrances, paintings, drawings,
            tattoos, and food, to name a few.
